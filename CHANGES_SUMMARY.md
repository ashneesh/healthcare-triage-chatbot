# Changes Summary - Frontend-Backend Connection Fix

## üêõ Problem Identified

Your frontend was showing "Waiting for chatbot" because there was a **mismatch in environment variable names**.

### Root Cause

- `App.tsx` was looking for: `VITE_WS_BASE_URL`
- `vercel.json` was providing: `VITE_WS_URL`
- Result: WebSocket URL was undefined, falling back to localhost

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `App.tsx` (Line 248)

```diff
- if (import.meta.env.VITE_WS_BASE_URL) {
-   return `${import.meta.env.VITE_WS_BASE_URL}/ws/chat/${sessionId.current}`;
+ if (import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL) {
+   return `${import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL}/ws/chat/${sessionId.current}`;
```

### 2. Updated `vercel.json`

Already configured correctly with your Render backend:

```json
"build": {
  "env": {
    "VITE_API_URL": "https://chatbot-gome.onrender.com",
    "VITE_WS_URL": "wss://chatbot-gome.onrender.com"
  }
}
```

### 3. Created Documentation

- ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Full deployment guide
- ‚úÖ `QUICK_START.md` - Fast deployment steps
- ‚úÖ `VERCEL_DEPLOY_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step Vercel instructions
- ‚úÖ `scripts/deploy.sh` - Interactive deployment helper

## üöÄ Next Steps for You

### Quick Deploy (2 minutes)

1. **Commit the changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix WebSocket connection - update env var name in App.tsx"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-redeploy** (if you have auto-deploy enabled)

   - OR go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Redeploy

3. **Verify environment variables in Vercel**:

   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Make sure these are set:
     - `VITE_API_URL` = `https://chatbot-gome.onrender.com`
     - `VITE_WS_URL` = `wss://chatbot-gome.onrender.com`

4. **Test your site**!

---

## üß™ Verification

Your backend is already confirmed working:

```bash
‚úÖ Backend: https://chatbot-gome.onrender.com
‚úÖ Health: {"status":"healthy","services":{"api":"healthy","websocket":"healthy","rasa":"healthy"}}
‚úÖ CORS: Configured to allow all origins
‚úÖ WebSocket: Enabled and working
```

After redeploying frontend:

- Status should show: "Connected" (green dot)
- You can send messages
- Bot will respond

## üìÅ Files Modified

```
frontend/src/App.tsx                    - Fixed environment variable name
frontend/vercel.json                    - Already correct (no changes needed)
scripts/deploy.sh                       - Updated example URLs
DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md                     - New file
QUICK_START.md                          - New file

CHANGES_SUMMARY.md                      - This file
```

---

## üîç How to Confirm It's Working

1. **Open your Vercel URL**
2. **Check connection status**: Should see green dot + "Connected"
3. **Open DevTools Console** (F12): Should see "WebSocket connected"
4. **Send a test message**: "Hello"
5. **Bot should respond**: Welcome message or response

---

## üí° Why This Happened

The environment variable names need to match exactly:

- Build-time variables in `vercel.json` ‚Üí `VITE_*`
- Runtime access in code ‚Üí `import.meta.env.VITE_*`

The names must match character-for-character:

- ‚ùå `VITE_WS_BASE_URL` ‚â† `VITE_WS_URL`
- ‚úÖ `VITE_WS_URL` = `VITE_WS_URL`

---

## üìû Support

If you still see issues after redeploying:

1. Check `VERCEL_DEPLOY_STEPS.md` for troubleshooting
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Verify environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
4. Make sure Render backend is awake (free tier spins down)

---

## ‚ú® Summary

**Before**: Frontend couldn't connect to backend (wrong env var name)
**After**: Frontend will connect to `wss://chatbot-gome.onrender.com`

Just push to Git and redeploy! üéâ
